# Overview
Spoofer is a server-sided module for Roblox that allows you to assign any user ID to a client, with the server interpreting the client as if they truly have that separate ID. With Spoofer, all actions, requests, and events from the client appear to originate from the assigned ID.

# Key Features
- Simulated User IDs: Test interactions with various user IDs, such as viewing a game from the perspective of another user.
- Permission Testing: Emulate permissions associated with different roles by assigning IDs tied to specific user roles.
- Bug Reproduction: Simulate specific user-reported bugs by temporarily assuming their ID.
- DataStore Testing: Verify data handling by testing interactions as specific user IDs.
